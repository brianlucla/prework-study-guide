# <Prework Study Guide>

## Description
I built this Prework Study Guide in order to help users study the topics covered in the prework modules of the Fullstack bootcamp. This Study Guide will help users pick from the topics of "HTML", "CSS", "JavaScript", and "Git" and provide notes for these topics. From this project, I learned how to set up a basic webpage, use CSS to style the webpage, some basic coding practices with JavaScript, and how to use Git and Github to update code and build a project.


## Installation

## Usage

Each section of the webpage contains notes on the four topics "HTML", "CSS", "Git", and "JavaScript" respectively. Using the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running. This script lists the topics that were covered in the Prework modules, and chooses a random topic for the user to study.
